<p><strong>Estimated time needed:</strong> 45 minutes</p>
<h2><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Software Used in this Assignment</h2><p>The instruction videos in this course use the full Excel Desktop version as this has all the available product features, but for the hands-on labs we will be using the free <em>Excel for the web</em> version as this is available to everyone.</p>
<p>Although you can use the Excel Desktop software if you have access to this version, <ins> it is recommended that you use Excel for the web for the hands-on labs </ins> as the lab instructions specifically refer to this version, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features. If you do not yet have access to Excel for the Web, you can follow the instructions in the following lab to get started with it: <a href="https://cocl.us/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0130EN-HandsOnLab-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hands-on Lab: Introduction to Excel for the web</a>. </p>
<h2><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Dataset Used in this Assignment</h2><p>The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: <a href="https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&amp;type=Data&amp;product=Cognos%20Analytics&amp;industry=Automotive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&amp;type=Data&amp;product=Cognos%20Analytics&amp;industry=Automotive</a> in the <strong>IBM Accelerator Catalog</strong>. The Terms of use for such are located at <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/</a>.</p>
<p>We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.</p>
<h2><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Assignment Scenario</h2><p>As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to create some visualizations to allow you to understand your car sales and profits for each dealer.</p>
<h2><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Guidelines for the Submission</h2><p>Download the file <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0130EN-SkillsNetwork/Hands-on%20Labs/Peer%20Graded%20Assignment%20-%20Part%201/CarSalesByModelStart.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CarSalesByModelStart.xlsx</a>. Upload and open the file in Excel for the web.</p>
<p>Use the course videos and hands-on lab from Module 1 Lesson 1 <em>Creating Charts</em> to help you complete the following tasks.</p>
<p><ins>Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:</ins></p>
<p>TASK 1: <strong>Quantity Sold by Dealer ID</strong> - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to <em>Quantity Sold by Dealer ID</em> (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use <em>Format</em> on the <em>Chart</em> tab to change the chart title) </p>
<p>TASK 2: <strong>Profit by Date and Model</strong> - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of <em>Profit by Date and Model</em> (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet2, and use <em>Chart Title</em> on the <em>Chart</em> tab to change the chart title)  </p>
<p>TASK 3: <strong>Profit by Year and Dealer ID</strong> - as a column chart, titled <em>Profit by Year and Dealer ID</em> with the data columns in red (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet3, and use <em>Format</em> on the <em>Chart</em> tab to change the chart title and to format the <em>series</em> fill color in red)</p>
<p>TASK 4: <strong>Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID</strong> - as a line chart, titled <em>Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID</em>. Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet4, use <em>Gridlines</em> in the <em>Axes</em> group on the <em>Chart</em> tab to remove the gridlines, and use <em>Format</em> on the <em>Chart</em> tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the <em>series</em> outline color in green)</p>
<p>TASK 5: <strong>Save your workbook:</strong> Use <em>Save As</em> to save your completed workbook as <strong>CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx</strong></p>
